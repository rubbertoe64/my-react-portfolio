            <p className="p-text"> Hello! My name is Roberto Gonzalez and I am an aspiring web developer. I am very new to the world of react and web development as a whole but with the recent online course I took, I feel like I gained a lot of confidence in my coding job searching journey! I come from a family of mostly construction workers and have worked in a field similar to that, but I got tired of the random work hours from my previous job and decided to start my coding journey with the UCSD Extension Full Stack Flex Web Development program. I have done multiple projects within the program that has helped me collaborate with others and develop code in a work like setting.   </p>
